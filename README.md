Portflio Web Application. Project Specification from 'IT Career Switch'.

Client Specification: “Create a desktop website that can also run on a mobile that allows for the maintenance of a company personnel database to see who’s who, which department they are in and where they are”.

The product is intended to be a standalone, single page application that is designed to be mobile first, but work equally as well on desktops. 
The application will allow the user to manipulate the database using a simple interface which connects front-end components to server-side endpoints to achieve this result.
